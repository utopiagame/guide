<h2 id="section-1">Dragon Types</h2>

<p>Be careful, my liege, these dangerous and powerful beasts can wreak havoc on any kingdom they are ravaging. They can be the difference between a victory and a loss during intense wars. Our monarch or steward can begin a dragon project against our enemies, which will need to be funded with gold before it will begin to attack. Dragons can be slain but it is a costly endeavor and no troops sent against them will survive.</p>

<p>There are four difference dragons that disrupt various functions and have varying funding costs and health levels. While all dragons will lower the income and draft of the enemy provinces, the additional impacts each can cause are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span class="red">Sapphire</span> - This dragon has the lowest health and reduces the magic and thievery effectiveness of the enemy.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Gold</span> - This dragon reduces the enemy's building efficiency.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Ruby</span> - This dragon reduces military effectiveness.</li>
	<li><span class="red">Emerald</span> - This dragon has the most health and increases enemy military casualties in combat and reduces the enemy's attack gains.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="section-2">Funding a Dragon</h2>

<p>The Monarchy has begun a dragon project at our enemies and is requesting assistance in funding the launch. The cost of the dragon is calculated at the time the dragon is started and takes into consideration the networth of both our kingdom and the target kingdom, and the type of dragon sent. From lowest to highest cost, the dragon projects are Sapphire, Gold, Ruby, and Emerald.</p>

<p>Dragon health is also dependent on the relations we have with the target kingdom at the time the dragon project is completed.  A dragon will have maximum health if the project is completed while we are at war with the target and will be reduced if our relations are Hostile and further reduced if we are Unfriendly.</p>

<h2 id="section-3">Killing a Dragon</h2>

<p>A dragon has begun ravaging our lands! Quickly my liege, action is required. Soldiers, offense specialists, defense specialists and elites are all willing to march against the dragon and will cause damage equivalent to their highest stat, however they will all perish. For example, if an elite has 7 offense and 8 defense normally, it will cause 8 damage to a dragon.  Choose wisely my leige, as many lives lie in the balance of your decision.</p>

<h2 id="section-4">Ritual Types</h2>

<p>Kingdom Rituals are available throughout the age and provide various benefits outlined here.  By working together with your Kingdom everyone will have an opportunity, once your Monarch begins a Kingdom Ritual, to assist in the successful casting and completion of the event.  Rituals are quite a challenge to undertake so be sure to plan carefully my Leige, for it takes at least 40 successful casts of the Ritual spell which is of the highest difficulty and supremely expensive!  Within 48 days your Kingdom must complete at least 40 casts or your hard work will be for naught.  The effects listed below are considered the standard effects which can be attained by casting our Ritual spell 80 times.  We may cast it more than 80 times however our efforts will have a diminishing return for each successful cast over 80.</p>

<p>Kingdom Rituals will cover your lands for a period of 120 days. Their bonuses affect all Kingdom members immediately upon completion and can not be removed by your enemies for at least 48 days.  Plan your strategy wisely and take advantage of their immense benefits:</p>
